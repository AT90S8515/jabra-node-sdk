Jabra Node.js Demo App

The demo shows how to easily use call-control parts of the Jabra NodeJs SDK (@gnaudio/jabra-node-sdk) from within a secure, sandboxed render process using the electron helper (@gnaudio/jabra-electron-renderer-helper).

To run the application open a command shell and execute the following:

```
npm install
npm run start
```
